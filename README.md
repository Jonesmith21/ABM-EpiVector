# ABM-EpiVector
A MATLAB toolbox for simulating the epidemiological dynamics of vector-borne diseases using an agent-based model. This tool integrates SEIR and SEI compartmental models to represent disease transmission between humans and vectors in a spatially structured environment.

##  Key Features

- **Agent-based simulation** of human and vector populations.  
- **SEIR model for humans** and **SEI model for vectors** to track infection states over time.  
- **Dynamic spatial maps** for movement behaviors based on environmental conditions.  
- **Customizable parameters** for infection probabilities, vector lifecycles, and human mobility.  
- **Visualization tools** for generating time-series plots, state evolution graphs, and GIF animations.  
 
##  Simulation Overview  

The simulation progresses in **daily time steps**, where:  
 -Vectors **move, bite, and infect hosts**.  
 -Humans **commute between home and work locations**.  
 -Infection dynamics are updated based on **interaction probabilities**.  

Users can **define initial population conditions, modify transmission parameters, and extract data** for **epidemiological analysis**.
